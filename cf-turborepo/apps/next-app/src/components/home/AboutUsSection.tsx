          The website is designed to inform, inspire, and support people
          affected by cystic fibrosis â€“ both patients and their loved ones.
          Here, you will find the latest news and events, valuable information
          about the disease, inspiring stories, and an online store with
          handmade products. The proceeds from sales and donations support the
          cause of improving patients' lives. The project is carried out by a
          team of IT specialists united by the desire to make a positive impact
          and support the community in the fight against cystic fibrosis.
